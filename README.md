# 📜 Blockchain Certificate Verification  

## 🔗 Project Overview  
This project provides a **secure and decentralized solution** for issuing, storing, and verifying academic and professional certificates using **Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts**. By leveraging **Solidity, Web3, and cryptographic hashing**, this system ensures **tamper-proof and verifiable** credentials.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Decentralized Verification** – Certificates are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.  
✅ **Smart Contracts (Solidity)** – Ensures immutability and security of issued certificates.  
✅ **Cryptographic Hashing** – Protects certificate integrity against fraud.  
✅ **Web3 API (Python)** – Enables certificate issuance and verification.  
✅ **Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana** – Tracks blockchain transactions and system performance.  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity  
- **Backend:** Python, Web3.py  
- **Database:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage  
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Security:** SHA-256 Cryptographic Hashing  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Certificate Issuance**: The institution generates a hash of the certificate and registers it on the blockchain via a **Solidity smart contract**.  
2️⃣ **Storage**: The certificate details are stored **securely** on IPFS.  
3️⃣ **Verification**: A user submits a certificate for verification, and the system checks the hash on the blockchain to ensure authenticity.  

## 📦 Installation & Setup  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imad-chakour/blockchain-certificate-verification.git
cd blockchain-certificate-verification
